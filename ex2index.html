            <p>Placements : Placements in our college are average. Almost 5-6 good companies visit the campus for placements of every department. The previous year, the placement rate was about 43%. Placements drives are conducted in the third year itself. The college organises a few exams that help us clear all the arrear and get placed. Though the number of companies that visit the campus to hire freshers is low, those few companies are really good ones with a high reputation.
