                <p id="p">Karunya was ordered to close two off-campus centres in Periyanaickenpalayam, which was opened without permission. In addition, a letter from the UGC showed that Karunya has not renewed its deemed-to-be-university status, which as expired in 2007.[7] The institute has agreed to close the centres, leaving 750 students to find other solutions, since the courses they were pursuing, management, science and social science courses, are not offered at Karunya's main campus. The UGC had also formed a committee of experts to inspect the institution.[8] Acting on the recommendations of said committee, in June 2018 an extension to the deemed-to-be-university status was granted for a period of five years.[9]It's all about the meaning. What "some"/"any" means is all that matters. "Some" means something limited in the context, whereas "any" emphasizes that there's no such limitation. For example, by "some information" you mean "a limited set of information given the context." By "any information", you mean "an unlimited set of information given the context."

(2) Generally, you have a limited set of information. Hence, "I have some information about the car accident." If, however, you'd like to emphasize that you know all about the car accident, you might be able to say, contrary to most usage books, "I have any information about the car accident", although the usual context makes it very unlikely.</p>
